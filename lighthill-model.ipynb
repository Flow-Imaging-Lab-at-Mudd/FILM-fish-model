    "# Lighthill's Elongated-Body Theory (EBT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lighthill's large-amplitude elongated-body theory utilizes reactive (rather than resistive) theory in order to interpret observational data on animal movements of arbitrary large amplitude. Reactive theory emphasizes reactive forces between a small volume of water and the parts of the animal's surface in contact with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lighthill's large-amplitude elongated-body theory applies to fish that swim with carangiform motion. Carangiform motion is characterized by fast forward motion, larger wave amplitudes towards the tail in the last half or one-third of the body length than in the anterior, and slower phase of lateral oscillations in this posterior section than that of the anterior. As a result, reactive forces seem to dominate in carangiform motion because the acceleration of water passed by the fish takes place very fast when the posterior section passes and flicks it into motion through the instantaneously acting virtual-mass effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Lighthill's 1971 paper is to extend reactive theory and slender-body theory so that it can be applied to interpret observational data on animal movements of arbitrary large amplitude. In this model, it is hopefully applied to carangiform movements. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of force and propulsion, Lighthill's elongated-body theory makes use of three principles in a frame of reference in which the water far from the fish is at rest:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Water momentum near a section of fish is in a direction perpendicular to the backbone and has magnitude equal to the virtual mass, $m$ per unit length, times the component $w$ of fish velocity in that direction.\n",
    "2. Thrust can be obtained by considering rate of change of momentum within a volume enclosing the fish whose boundary at each instant includes a flat surface $\\Pi$ perpendicular to the caudal fin through its posterior end.\n",
    "3. In the momentum balance it is necessary to take into account transfer of momentum across $\\Pi$ not only by convection but also by the action of the resultant $\\frac{1}{2} mw^2$ of the pressures generated by the motions within the plane $\\Pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinates used by Lighthill are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $y$-axis as the vertical\n",
    "* $x$-axis and $z$-axis as the horizontal\n",
    "* Lagrangian coordinate a along the fish body that takes values from 0 (tail) to $l$ (head), the length of the fish\n",
    "\n",
    "where a left-handed system of axes is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fish swims at a fixed horizontal level ($y=0$), where the constant mean direction of swimming is taken as that of the positive $x$-axis. Additionally, the position coordinates are regarded as $(x(a,t), z(a,t))$ as the point moves due (i) to swimming actions, (ii) to the resulting forward motion of the fish, and (iii) to any lateral recoil motions that may be involuntarily produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we have several notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $(u,w)$ is the horizontal velocity vector (in the Lagrangian fish body frame), where $u$ is the tangential component (forward direction) and $w$ is the perpendicular component (lateral direction) of the fish body\n",
    "* $(P,Q)$ is the force vector where $P$ is thrust and $Q$ is sideforce; $P$ is forward direction, $Q$ is lateral direction\n",
    "* $V$ is the magnitude of the $(u,w)$\n",
    "* $W$ is the component perpendicular to the direction of mean motion\n",
    "\n",
    "In an elongated body form, the virtual mass is large in respect of the $w$ motions, while the $u$ motions have negligible virtual mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inextensibility of the fish's spinal column requires $ \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a}\\right)^2 = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The horizontal velocity vector (in a left-handed $x-z$ coordinate system) $\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t}, \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} \\right)$ has a tangential component (relative to the spinal column) $u= \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a} + \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a}$ and a perpendicular component $w= \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a} - \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The momentum per unit length of fish is represented by the vector $mw\\left(-\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a}, \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a} \\right)$ where the factor in parentheses is a unit vector in the $w$-direction. $m$ is the given cross-section of the fish, which can be approximated by $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi \\rho s^2$, where $\\rho$ is the water density and $s$ is the depth of the cross-section. $m$ should be a fixed, known function $m(a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to use the rate of change of the momentum in the wake. A better approach would be to study the rate of change of momentum in a part $V$ that excludes the wake. This is done by considering a vertical plane $\\Pi$ intersecting the tip of the caudal fin at right angles to the tip of the spinal column. This plane swings around as the fine moves. At each instant, the part $V$ of water whose momentum is considered is that half-space, bounded by the plane $\\Pi$, which includes the fish and excludes the wake. The momentum in $V$ can be written as the integral of $mw \\left( -\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a}, \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a} \\right)$ from $0$ to $l$ with respect to $a$, and its rate of change can be written as the sum of three terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. rate of change due to convection of momentum out of $V$ across the plane $\\Pi$\n",
    "2. rate of change due to the pressure force acting across $\\Pi$\n",
    "3. minus the reactive force $(P,Q)$ with which the fluid acts on the fish\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, \n",
    "$(P,Q) = \\left[mw \\left( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t}, -\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2} mw^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a}, \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a} \\right) \\right]_{a=0} - \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{l} mw \\left(-\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a}, \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a} \\right) da$\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean thrust can be written as $\\overline{P} = \\overline{ \\left[ mw \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t}-\\frac{1}{2} w \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a} \\right) \\right]_{a=0}}$\n"
