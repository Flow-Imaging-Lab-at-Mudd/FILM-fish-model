    "## Lighthill's Elongated-Body Theory (EBT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lighthill's large-amplitude elongated-body theory utilizes reactive (rather than resistive) theory in order to interpret observational data on animal movements of arbitrary large amplitude. Reactive theory emphasizes reactive forces between a small volume of water and the parts of the animal's surface in contact with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lighthill's large-amplitude elongated-body theory applies to fish that swim with carangiform motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lighthill's elongated-body theory makes use of three principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Water momentum near a section of fish is in a direction perpendicular to the backbone and has magnitude equal to the virtual mass, $m$ per unit length, times the component $w$ of fish velocity in that direction.\n",
    "2. Thrust can be obtained by considering rate of change of momentum within a volume enclosing the fish whose boundary at each instant includes a flat surface $\\Pi$ perpendicular to the caudal fin through its posterior end.\n",
    "3. In the momentum balance it is necessary to take into account transfer of momentum across $\\Pi$ not only by convection but also by the action of the resultant $\\frac{1}{2} mw^2$ of the pressures generated by the motions within the plane $\\Pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinates used by Lighthill are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $y$-axis as the vertical\n",
    "* $x$-axis and $z$-axis as the horizontal\n",
    "* Lagrangian coordinate a along the fish body that takes values from 0 (tail) to $l$ (head), the length of the fish\n",
    "\n",
    "where a left-handed system of axes is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we have several notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $(u,w)$ is the horizontal velocity vector (in the Lagrangian fish body frame), where $u$ is the tangential component (forward direction) and $w$ is the perpendicular component (lateral direction) of the fish body\n",
    "* $(P,Q)$ is the force vector where $P$ is thrust and $Q$ is sideforce; $P$ is forward direction, $Q$ is lateral direction\n",
    "* $V$ is the magnitude of the $(u,w)$\n",
    "* $W$ is the component perpendicular to the direction of mean motion\n",
    "\n",
    "In an elongated body form, the virtual mass is large in respect of the $w$ motions, while the $u$ motions have negligible virtual mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inextensibility of the fish's spinal column requires $ \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a}\\right)^2 = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The horizontal velocity vector (in a left-handed $x-z$ coordinate system) $\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t}, \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} \\right)$ has a tangential component (relative to the spinal column) $u= \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a} + \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a}$ and a perpendicular component $w= \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a} - \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The momentum per unit length of fish is represented by the vector $mw\\left(-\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a}, \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a} \\right)$ where the factor in parentheses is a unit vector in the $w$-direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, \n",
    "$(P,Q) = \\left[mw \\left( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t}, -\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2} mw^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a}, \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a} \\right) \\right]_{a=0} - \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{l} mw \\left(-\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a}, \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a} \\right) da$\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean thrust can be written as $\\overline{P} = \\overline{ \\left[ mw \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t}-\\frac{1}{2} w \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a} \\right) \\right]_{a=0}}$\n"
