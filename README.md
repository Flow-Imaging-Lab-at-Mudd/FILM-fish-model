# FILM Fish Model

This is the repository for Professor Mendelson's Flow Imaging Lab. The research is dedicated to fish locomotion, specifically fish jumping.

## Mathematica

The Mathematica notebook documents Lighthill's elongated-body theory (1971) and Borazjani and Sotiropoulos' carangiform model (2008). The inextensibility of the fish's body length in Borazjani and Sotiropoulos' model was confirmed. Further work includes finding momentum and force vectors as outlined in Lighthill's model, although we are retiring the Mathematica notebook in favor of Jupyter/iPython notebooks as there is better support and rendering with GitHub.

## Python

The Python files should reflect the work done in the Mathematica notebook as of spring 2018. These Python files along with the Mathematica notebook will contribute to the Jupyter/iPython notebook(s) starting summer 2018.

## Jupyter/iPython

The Jupyter/iPython notebook(s) are a work in progress as of summer 2018. The overall goal is to have a working model that can be tested with the tank and mechatronics setup. We hope to have our model to account for physical results such as

* jumping height
* force and thrust
* waveform efficiency
* loss of force production when jumping out of the water
* the point of (force) diminishing returns on the fish
